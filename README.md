* 👋 Hi, I’m Darth_Eternalfaith. Or youcan call me "DEF". Sometimes the "Darth_Eternalfaith" is too long and "DEF" has been registered. I will use "Darth_EF".
* Today, I'm three years old. I dropped out of kindergarten.
* My all the skills is come from immortal guiding in a dream.
* I study in a dream, had nearly three hundred year. But when I woke up, I mostly forgot. When I want to think that dream, too late.It was beyond recall.
* Now my monthly pay will be 3000￥(cnm)(cny)(人民币元), After deductions of tax, rent, water, electricity, metro tickets and other. I can use 800-1000 to buy food. A half roast duck need 28, so i can eat it everday!
