* ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Darth_Eternalfaith. Or youcan call me "DEF". Sometimes the "Darth_Eternalfaith" is too long and "DEF" has been registered. I wall use "Darth_EF".
* Today, I'm three years old. I dropped out of kindergarten.
* I study in a dream, had nearly three hundred year. But when I woke up, I mostly forgot. When I want to think that dream, too late.It was beyond recall.
